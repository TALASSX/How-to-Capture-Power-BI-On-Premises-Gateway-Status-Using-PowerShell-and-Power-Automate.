# How-to-Capture-Power-BI-On-Premises-Gateway-Status-Using-PowerShell-and-Power-Automate.
The script retrieves all the gateway details for which you have access,
then iterates over those gateways to fetch the status, name, and other details. To capture this data every hour,
I've set up a Power Automate Desktop flow to execute the PowerShell script, and the output is stored in an Excel sheet on OneDrive.
I hope this project helps you in capturing the on-premises gateway status from Power BI Service. Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š
